      <img src="../design/images/white-line.png" class="underline">
      <strong>Experience the charm and individuality of an independently owned and operated coffee shop.</strong>
      <p>The Depot Coffee House is committed to supplying the highest quality coffee, locally sourced fresh food and the finest in live entertainment.</p>
      <p>We proudly offer Crimson Cup Coffee, a handcrafted coffee roaster based an hour east of us in Columbus. Crimson Cup travels the world (Africa, Central and South America, Indonesia and Hawaii) to discover and purchase directly from farmers and eliminate the "middle man". The "middle man" is eliminated to assure the integrity of the trade and offer a variety of blends, organic, and fair trade coffee! Along with coffee, we also carry a variety of teas and smoothies!</p>
      <p>In addition to our beverages, we are proud to offer some of the best in local cuisine! Stop by for a quick bite, whether it's a muffin with your coffee, a breakfast croissant or a hot pressed Panini for lunch. Take a peak at our menu for all of our additional options and be sure to ask about seasonal specials!</p>
      <p>Call-in orders are welcome for dine in or carry out.</p>
